      <blockquote class="text-lg text-zinc-500 leading-8 pt-10 font-semibold">“I have had many opportunities throughout my nursing career to help ease the patient journey, either by reducing symptoms related to their disease or treatment, or by helping to reduce the logistical burden of navigating health care. Too, I have been fortunate to be able to help patients, families, and clinicians work on their resilience and perseverance in many settings. More recently, I have been able to help integrate behavioral health into primary care spaces, helping to reduce the time it takes patients to receive specialized care.”</blockquote>
